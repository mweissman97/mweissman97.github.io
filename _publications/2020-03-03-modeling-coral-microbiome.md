excerpt: 'The coral microbiome is essential to the health of coral reefs and sensitive to environmental changes. We found that the microbiome was best predicted by a model that took into account the temperature profile that was closest to the local thermal environment, regardless of the microbial network profile.'

Coral microbiome dysbiosis (i.e., shifts in the microbial community structure or complete loss of microbial symbionts) caused by environmental changes is a key player in the decline of coral health worldwide. Multiple factors in the water column and the surrounding biological community influence the dynamics of the coral microbiome. However, by including only temperature as an external factor, our model proved to be successful in describing the microbial community associated with the surface mucus layer (SML) of the coral P. strigosa. The dynamic model developed and validated in this study is a potential tool to predict the coral microbiome under different temperature conditions.
