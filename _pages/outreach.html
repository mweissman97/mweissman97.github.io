<p><b>I really like coloring. So much so that, in 2013, I drew my first coloring booklet. Since then, I have distributed thousands of physical and digital copies of my books across the country. I am excited to use my art to inspire the next generation of scientists and communicate ideas from my own research to a larger audience.</p></b>
