I am a computational biologist and first year PhD student in the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/). 

I am broadly interested in using mathematical and biological toolsets in order to explore questions of evolution. I am currently working on computational methods to model the evolution of modifiers of the fidelity of genetic information transmission within and between organisms.

Previously, I graduated with my B.S. from San Diego State University, where I studied [the coral reef microbiome](https://mweissman97.github.io/portfolio/2_coralmicrobiome/) and [HIV pharmacodynamics](https://mweissman97.github.io/portfolio/3_hiv/) as a member of [The DiMoLab](https://nvaidya.sdsu.edu/DiMoLab.html).
