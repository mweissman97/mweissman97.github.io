I am a computational biologist and genetecist. I received my PhD from Brown University in May 2024, where I conducted research as a member of the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/). My research interests include population genetics, ecology, conservation genomics, and infectious diseases. My PhD thesis focused on the evolution of bet hedging, a widespread strategy to reduce risk in the face of unpredictable environmental change.

I also love making coloring books to communicate big ideas and engage scientists of all ages. Check out my STEAM [coloring books](https://www.sciencemaya.com/outreach).
