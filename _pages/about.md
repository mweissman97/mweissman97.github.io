I am a computational biologist and PhD student in the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/). 

I am broadly interested in using mathematical and biological toolsets in order to explore questions of evolution. My research is on evolvability, bet-hedging, phenotypic noise, sign inversion, and modifiers of the fidelity of genetic information transmission.
