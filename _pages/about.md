I am a computational biologist and PhD candidate in the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/). 

I am broadly interested in using mathematical and biological toolsets in order to explore questions of evolution. My research is on the evolution of bet hedging, a widespread strategy to reduce risk in the face of unpredictable environmental change. Mathematically, bet hedging is when a lineage lowers its fitness variance at the expense of also lowering mean fitness across environments. I aim to investigate the ways in which randomness in reproduction and environment defy our expectations, and determine the extent to which bet hedging is a "good bet."

I also love making coloring books to communicate big ideas and engage scientists of all ages. Check out my STEAM [coloring books](https://www.sciencemaya.com/outreach).
