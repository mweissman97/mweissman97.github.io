# About the Book
This book is about my Undergraduate Thesis Research on [the coral reef microbiome](https://www.sciencemaya.com/portfolio/2_coralmicrobiome/). This book teaches students about the relationship between coral and the microbes that live on them, the differences between different reef zones, and the effect of temperature on coral reef health.

# For Educators
Working with educators from a diverse range of disciplines and locations, this books was developed with the Next Generation Science and Common Core Standards in mind. In addition to providing the books as a free resource, I am happy to speak with classrooms and talk about my research, the coloring book, and my own journey to become a scientist. Please [reach out](mailto:maya_weissman@brown.edu) if you have any questions or requests. I hope that from homeschool to public school, you will find my books both fun and educational.

This coloring book meets the following Next Generation Science Standards:
* LS1.1: Conduct an investigation to provide evidence that living things are made of cells; either one cell or many different numbers and types of cells.
* LS1.5: Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for how environmental and genetic factors influence the growth of organisms.
* LS2.1: Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence for the effects of resource availability on organisms and populations of organisms in an ecosystem.
* LS2.2: Construct an explanation that predicts patterns of interactions among organisms across multiple ecosystems.
* LS2.4: Construct an argument supported by empirical evidence that changes to physical or biological components of an ecosystem affect populations.
* LS4.2: Use evidence to construct an explanation for how the variations in characteristics among individuals of the same species may provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing.
* LS4.3: Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.
* LS4.4: Make a claim about the merit of a solution to a problem caused when the environment changes and the types of plants and animals that live there may change.
* ESS2.2: Obtain and combine information to describe climates in different regions of the world.
* 

And the following English Language Arts Common Core Standards:
* 5.2: Determine two or more main ideas of a text and explain how they are supported by key details; summarize the text.
* 5.3: Explain the relationships or interactions between two or more individuals, events, ideas, or concepts in a historical, scientific, or technical text based on specific information in the text.
* 5.4: Determine the meaning of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases in a relevant text.
* 5.7: Draw on information from multiple print or digital sources, demonstrating the ability to locate an answer to a question quickly or to solve a problem efficiently.
* 3.10: By the end of the year, read and comprehend informational texts, including history/social studies, science, and technical texts.
* 3.7: Use information gained from illustrations (e.g., maps, photographs) and the words in a text to demonstrate understanding of the text (e.g., where, when, why, and how key events occur).
