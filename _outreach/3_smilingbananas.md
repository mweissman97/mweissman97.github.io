# About the Book
This was my first book ever! I wrote this book because I had a passion for science, and I wanted to share how diverse careers in science and math could be. In partnership with the South Lake Chamber of Commerce, Down Syndrome Association of Central Florida, and numerous local classrooms, I was able to pass out over 2,000 copies of this book while I was still in high school. Now that I am conducting my own research, I'm excited to draw on the science and scientists in my own life for my books.

# For Educators
Working with educators from a diverse range of disciplines and locations, this books was developed with the Next Generation Science and Common Core Standards in mind. In addition to providing the books as a free resource, I am happy to speak with classrooms and talk about my research, the coloring book, and my own journey to become a scientist. Please [reach out](mailto:maya_weissman@brown.edu) if you have any questions or requests. I hope that from homeschool to public school, you will find my books both fun and educational.
