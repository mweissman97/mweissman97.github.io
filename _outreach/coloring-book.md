# Color and Learn!
[Volume 2: The Coral Microbiome](/files/cb_coralmicrobiome.pdf) teaches kids about the coral reef microbiome, and is inspired by my [undergrad research](http://www.sciencemaya.com/portfolio/2_coralmicrobiome/).

[Volume 1: Smiling Bananas](/files/SB_coloringbook.pdf) is a coloring booklet aimed at introducing STEM careers to kids.

# History
In 2013, I drew a coloring booklet because I wanted to share my love for science with others. The first volume featured a brief exploration of stem careers, and partnering with local schools, the South Lake Chamber of Commerce, and the Central Florida Down syndrome Association, I was able to distribute over 2,000 physical copies of the first volume.

Growing up, I always knew I wanted to be a scientist. I enjoyed experimenting with physics, trying to determine the exact amount of force needed to flip my motherâ€™s kayak into the lake, even in just melted, ice cold water. I tested out messy chemistry experiments in the kitchen with my grandmother, frequently ignoring recipes in the name of scientific inquiry. I loved thinking about biology, picking up organisms (that I was not supposed to touch) along hikes and snorkel trips. My favorite, however, was always mathematics. There was something almost magical about the truths found within equations, the way solving a difficult problem felt like solving a great mystery. I knew I wanted to be a scientist, but I didn't always know what kind of research I wanted to do.

Now, I have achieved my childhood dream: studying evolution using computer science, mathematics, and biology. Getting to this point was not without its challenges, however. As a woman in computational biology, I have often struggled to see myself represented in the field. In high school, a substitute teacher once told me that girls are not designed to be good at mathematics. I stayed away from computer science because it was always marketed towards boys who enjoyed video games, and I dreaded being the only girl in the room. It took me a long time to discover my own love for computational work, and I hope that I can help other young scientists find the confidence and the passion for science.

# For Educators
Working with educators from a diverse range of disciplines and locations, these books are developed with the Next Generation Science and Common Core Standards in mind. In addition to providing the books as a free resource, I am happy to speak with classrooms and talk about my research, the coloring book, and my own journey to become a scientist. Please [reach out](mailto:maya_weissman@brown.edu) if you have any questions or request. I hope that from homeschool to public school, you will find my books both fun and educational.

My coloring books meet the following standards:
* [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org/search-standards?keys=&tid%5B%5D=102)
  * 3-LS1-1 From molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes: Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death.
  * 3-LS2-1 Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics: Construct an argument that some animals form groups that help members survive.
  * 3-LS3-2 Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits: Use evidence to support the explanation that traits can be influenced by the environment.
  * 5-ESS2-1 Earth's Systems: Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.
* [Crosscutting Concepts in NGSS](https://static.nsta.org/ngss/MatrixOfCrosscuttingConcepts.pdf)
  * Cause and effect relationships are routinely identified, tested, and used to explain change. 
  * Natural objects and/or observable phenomena exist from the very small to the immensely large or from very short to very long time periods.
  * A system is a group of related parts that make up a whole and can carry out functions its individual parts cannot.
  * A system can be described in terms of its components and their interactions.
* [English Language Arts Common Core](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RI/5/)
  * CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.5.2: Determine two or more main ideas of a text and explain how they are supported by key details; summarize the text.
  * CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.5.3: Explain the relationships or interactions between two or more individuals, events, ideas, or concepts in a historical, scientific, or technical text based on specific information in the text.
  * CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.5.4: Determine the meaning of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases in a text relevan.
  * CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.5.7: Draw on information from multiple print or digital sources, demonstrating the ability to locate an answer to a question quickly or to solve a problem efficiently.
  * CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.10: By the end of the year, read and comprehend informational texts, including history/social studies, science, and technical texts, at the high end of the grades 2-3 text complexity band independently and proficiently.
  * CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.7: Use information gained from illustrations (e.g., maps, photographs) and the words in a text to demonstrate understanding of the text (e.g., where, when, why, and how key events occur).
