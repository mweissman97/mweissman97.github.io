# Color and Learn!
[Volume 2: The Coral Microbiome](/files/cb_coralmicrobiome.pdf) teaches kids about the coral reef microbiome, and is inspired by my [undergrad research](http://www.sciencemaya.com/portfolio/2_coralmicrobiome/).

[Volume 1: Smiling Bananas](/files/SB_coloringbook.pdf) is a coloring booklet aimed at introducing STEM careers to kids.

# History
In 2013, I drew a silly little coloring book. I wanted to share my excitement for STEM with elementary school aged students, and so the first volume featured a brief exploration of stem careers. Partnering with local schools, the South Lake Chamber of Commerce, and the Central Florida Down syndrome Association, I was able to distribute over 2,000 physical copies of the first volume.

Becoming a scientist was my childhood dream, and now that I am conducting research of my own, I want to share the research I'm excited about with the next generation of scientists.
