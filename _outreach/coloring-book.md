# Color and Learn!
<a href="myFile.js" download>Volume 1: Smiling Bananas</a> is a fun coloring book aimed at introducing STEM careers to kids!

# History
In 2013, I drew a silly little coloring book. I wanted to share my excitement for STEM with elementary school aged students, and so the first volume featured a brief exploration of stem careers. Partnering with local schools, the South Lake Chamber of Commerce, and the Central Florida Down syndrome Association, I was able to distribute over 2,000 physical copies of the first volume.
