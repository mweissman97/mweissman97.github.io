## What's a model with you?
The SIR Model is where all epidemiological models start, and was my personal introduction into math modeling so it holds a special place in my heart. The SIR Model is as simple as you can get while still being useful.

This model is a **compartment model**, which means it treats everyone in a population as a member of a compartment. Over the course of time, individuals move between compartments, and those dynamics are captured using a series of differential equations. In the case of the SIR model, we assume three compartments, or subsets of the population: **Susceptible, Infected,** and **Removed**.

The SIR Model is also **deterministic**, which means there are no random elements so you can get the same answer every time. That means that we are assuming a well-mixed population; everyone in our model has an equal chance of running into everyone else.
