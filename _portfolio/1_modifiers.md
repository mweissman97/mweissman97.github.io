Current work with the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/population-genetics-modifier-mutations) will involve modeling the evolution of stochastic noise, a type of modifier. Modifiers are genes that influence the fidelity of genetic information transfer within an individual, over space and time, and across generations.

Stochastic noise is the phenomena where identical genotypes produce a large variance in phenotypes. Stochastic noise plays a role in bet hedging strategies, adaptation to extreme environments, phase strategies in bacteria, the lytic/lysogenic cycle in viruses, and more.
