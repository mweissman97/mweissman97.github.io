Two of the most daunting obstacles to HIV cure are the establishment of HIV reservoirs in the form of latently infected cells that are unaffected by current methods of treatment and the ability of virus to acquire antiretroviral treatment (ART) resistance through mutation.

Research found that the success of the treatment, in both minimizing a latent reservoir and avoiding ART resistance, is reliant on early treatment using a regimen with a good pharmacodynamics profile.
