Working on developing the first model of its kind, the mathematical model presented explains variations in microbiome composition as a function of temperature. The model was first validated by using it to explain the difference between coral in the inner and outer reef zones.

The model can be extended to predict the effect of climate change on the microbiome. Large departures from current temperature conditions can cause large shifts in the composition of the microbiome that could cause increased susceptibility to black band disease.
