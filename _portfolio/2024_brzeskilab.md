Part-time postdoctoral researcher with the [Brzeski Lab](https://www.mtu.edu/forest/about/faculty-staff/faculty/brzeski/) at Michigan Technological University. 

## Black Bear Pedigree Reconstruction
Using 3,000 black bear samples, I constructed a pedigree in order to identify likely parent-offspring pairs. This involved significant data filtering, population genomcs analyses, pedigree reconstruction using the Sequoia Package in R, and sensitivity analyses to validate results. Inferred parent-offspring pairs were used in a Close Kin Mark Recapture model that informed Michigan Department of Natural Resources harvest policy. 

## Canid Ancestry Panel Development
Analyzed 1,000 Canid DNA samples from five species to identify ancestry informative markers and develop a pipeline to infer individual identity and species assignment from limited or low quality sequence data.
