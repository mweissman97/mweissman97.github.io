**Graduate Thesis Research**

Environments can be unpredictable, and in the face of uncertainty organisms must choose how to best maximize their chances of survival. One way organisms can cope with environmental variability is by “hedging their bets,” as winning something is better than losing everything. Bet hedging is a widespread strategy for risk reduction where a population will suffer some cost in order to insulate themselves from the risk of a worst case scenario. Bet hedging is mathematically defined as a trade-off where a population will lower its average fitness in order to also lower its fitness variance. Common examples include:
* Delayed seed germination in annual plants: randomness in when a seed will germinate leads to the maintenance of a seed bank, ensuring that in a really bad year, some seeds will survive. [(Venable 2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17536393/)
* Bacterial persistence: some bacteria can randomly switch between a fast-growing but antibiotic susceptible phenotype and a slow-growing phenotype that can survive longer periods of antibiotic pressure. [(Balaban 2004)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1099390)
* Mouthbrooding in fish: some fish keep their eggs in their mouths as a form of parental care, which protects eggs from predation and other risks. However, mouthbrooders have fewer eggs, as there is limited space for eggs in their mouths. [(Weller 2022)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/719235)

My current work with the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/population-genetics-modifier-mutations) is all about modeling the evolution of bet hedging using stochastic simulations. I'm interested in answering questions like: does how we model evolution in changing environments matter? When are specific bet hedging strategies, like bacterial persistence and mouthbrooding, beneficial? How do different types of environmental variation impact the evolution of bet hedging?
