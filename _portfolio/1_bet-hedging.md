Current work with the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/population-genetics-modifier-mutations) focuses on the relationship between the evolution of bet-hedging, population size, environmental regime, and geometric mean fitness.

Environments can be unpredictable, and in the face of uncertainty organisms must choose how to best maximize their chances of survival. One way organisms can cope with environmental variability is by “hedging their bets,” as winning something is better than losing everything. Bet-hedging is mathematically defined as a trade-off for a lower arithmetic mean fitness in exchange for lower fitness variance in unpredictable environments.

Using individual-based stochastic simulations and numeric solutions of the corresponding Markov process, I am currently investigating situations where bet-hedging is beneficial.
