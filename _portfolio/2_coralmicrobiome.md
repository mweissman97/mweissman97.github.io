Coral reefs are some of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems on the planet, but an estimated 20% of the worldâ€™s coral reefs have been decimated due to stressors such as climate change, coral bleaching, and diseases such as black band disease. The microbiome associated with corals is essential to the health of coral reefs, and the composition and health of the microbiome can be affected by high environmental temperatures, eutrophication, and other stress conditions. As a member of the [SDSU DiMoLab](https://nvaidya.sdsu.edu/DiMoLab.html), we developed a mathematical model that explores the effect of temperature on coral reef microbiome composition.

First, we investigated whether temperature drove differences in composition between the inner and outer reef zones. The inner and outer reef zones exhibit distinct microbiome communities, and those differences are shaped by differences in water temperature, rather than network community structure. We also found that seasonal temperature variations are an important aspect in modeling microbiome composition. This work was recently published in [mBio](https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/2/e02691-19).

Next, we investigated the effect of changing temperatures on microbiome composition. As temperature profiles strayed further from the "normal" base case, we saw large changes to microbiome composition. Certain temperature conditions can also confer greater susceptibility to black band disease as a result of the peturbations to the microbiome composition.

This research was presented at the SDSU Student Research Symposium, where it won the [Undergraduate Research Excellence Award](https://research.sdsu.edu/research_affairs/student_research_symposium/2019%20Student%20Research%20Symposium%20Award%20Recipients%20Website.pdf), the research showcase for the [Inauguration of President Adela de la Torre](https://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news_story.aspx?sid=77584), and the [SIAM Southern California Applied Mathematics Symposium (SOCAMS)](https://www.siam.org/membership/sections/detail/siam-southern-california-section).
